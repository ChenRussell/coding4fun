/**
 * A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
 *
 * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
 * Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
 * sk == endWord
 * Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
 * endWord.length == beginWord.length
 * 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
 * wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
 * beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
 * beginWord != endWord
 * All the words in wordList are unique.

     * "The idea behind bidirectional search is to run two simultaneous searches―one forward from
     * the initial state and the other backward from the goal―hoping that the two searches meet in
     * the middle. The motivation is that b^(d/2) + b^(d/2) is much less than b^d. b is branch factor, d is depth. "

     * 1. It's much faster than one-end search indeed as explained in wiki.
     * 2. BFS isn't equivalent to Queue. Sometimes Set is more accurate representation for nodes of level. (also handy since we need to check if we meet from two ends)
     * 3. It's safe to share a visited set for both ends since if they meet same string it terminates early. (vis is useful since we cannot remove word from dict due to bidirectional search)
     * 4. It seems like if(set.add()) is a little slower than if(!contains()) then add() but it's more concise.
