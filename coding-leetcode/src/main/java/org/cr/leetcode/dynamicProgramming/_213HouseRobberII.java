/**
 * Created by ChenRui on 2018/9/22.
 * <p>
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.
 * That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security
 * system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into
 * on the same night.
 * <p>
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 * determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: [2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
 * because they are adjacent houses.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 * Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
